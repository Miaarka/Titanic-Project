# Titanic-Project
This analysis presents an in-depth study on the classification of the Titanic dataset by applying various machine learning algorithms, including K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Random Forest, and Naive Bayes. Each algorithm was systematically selected and implemented to test its performance and accuracy in predicting passenger survival based on the available features in the dataset.

In this analysis, every stage of data processing, from data cleaning, feature selection, to algorithm implementation, was meticulously carried out to ensure the validity of the results obtained. The findings of this analysis provide valuable insights into the strengths and weaknesses of each algorithm in the context of the Titanic dataset.

I hope this analysis can serve as a useful reference for researchers and practitioners who wish to further develop this study, whether in improving prediction accuracy or applying more advanced techniques to similar classification problems. This research also opens opportunities for further exploration in terms of model optimization and the application of other algorithms that may be more suitable for different datasets.
